What to implement:
Implement a simple broadcasting in your language of choice:
- Communicate through UDP
- The programs should communicate through messages having this format:
    - Message size should be fixed: 1024 bytes
    - Byte 0: should be the sending node index (order number)
    - Bytes 1-1003: random values
    - Bytes 1004-1023: SHA-1 of bytes 0-1003
- Configuration file
    - First line: number of broadcasts sent by each node
    - Remaining lines: IP PORT
    - Example:
      1000
      127.0.0.1 5000    # index 0
      127.0.0.1 5001    # index 1
      127.0.0.1 5002    # index 2
      127.0.0.1 5003    # index 3
      127.0.0.1 5004    # index 4
- Program arguments: config file path and node index
    - bcastnode config.txt 3
- Starting script arguments: config file, first node index, last node index
    - startnodes.sh config.txt 10 14
- Every broadcast should be sent to the source as well
- Every node should log all the messages received
    - First element: OK or FAIL depending on whether the sent SHA1 matches the calculated SHA1
    - Second element: source node index
    - Third element: the sent SHA1 (last 20 bytes of the message displayed as HEX)
    - Forth element: the calculated SHA1 of the message
    - Example
      OK 1 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
      OK 2 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567
      FAIL 0 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234aaa
- Log any errors in a separate file
- All nodes should start within 10 seconds
- All nodes should wait 15 seconds after startup before starting broadcasting
- A node should stop after sending N broadcasts and receiving N*M broadcasts (in the configuration file example M=5, N=1000)
- Message reading/writing should insist until all the expected message size is read/written, but no longer than 5 seconds
